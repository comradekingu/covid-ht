	<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ZO6EaAz465Y?t=570">{% translate "According to Dr. Eugenia Barrientos" %}</a>, {% translate "an ongoing viral infection can be detected from the results of an hemogram test, and, given the current COVID19 pandemic, all viral infections with cold and flu symptoms should be treated as COVID19 cases." %}</p>

	<p>{% translate "The inference from the hemogram test results is done based on the knowledge and experience of the Health Professional." %}</p>

	<p>{% translate "If that process could be automatized and widely available, the detection toolkit of Health Professionals will be improved." %}</p>

	<p>{% translate "In many places (i.e. Per√∫) where specific COVID19 testing is not widely available - saturated hospitals, not affordable or unavailable - hemogram blood testing is in the opposite: affordable and in widely distributed facilities." %}</p>

	<p>{% translate "If a viral infection classifier with an adequate accuracy through hemograms can be built and made publicly available, all Health Professionals with a smart-phone and Internet access could classify any hemogram with the same accuracy as top-level experts on the matter." %}</p>

	<p>{% translate "Early detection is deemed to be the greatest success factor in COVID19 treatments." %}</p>

	<p>{% translate "This project aims to provide a tool to efficiently build and manage that classifier and make it effectively available for widespread use in order to improve detection and increase the use efficiency of specific testing of COVID19." %}</p>

	<p><a href="https://github.com/math-a3k/covid-ht">{% translate "This tool is totally transparent" %}</a>: {% translate "you may audit it entirely to fully understand how it works, what it provides and its limitations. It is distributed under the GNU LGPLv3 license." %}</p>

	<p>{% translate "Improvements in early detection should increase successful treatments, potentially saving lives." %}</p>

	<p>{% translate "Better resource efficiency can also be achieved with the tool, i.e. only use expensive specific COVID19 testing for recovery after the hemogram does not indicate infection." %}</p>

	<p>{% translate "The tool is not a replacement of Health Professionals." %}</p>

	<p>{% translate "Any diagnostic and treatment should be decided by a Health Professional with the patient. If you are an individual with a recent hemogram result, the tool may indicate to take preemptive care and seek a Health Professional." %}</p>
