Beyond COVID19
==============

``covid-ht`` was motivated by helping with the struggle against the COVID19's pandemic in resource-constrainted places where specific testing wasn't available at sufficient quantities and triggered by `watching a Doctor`_ in El Salvador doing the process.

It is designed to be inclusive with those who want to improve their response, leveraging already existing infrastructure, incorporated into already ongoing practices and providing knowledge while it is developed locally if needed with networking.

Given that vaccines are already developed, at some point in the future, the pandemic will end.

After the pandemic, Health resources will be re-oriented towards others health conditions that have been misplaced by COVID19, specially in places where the Health System infrastructure was already insufficient and had to be focused on the pandemic.

Beyond COVID19, ``covid-ht`` provides an AI layer on top of measurements for classification.

That layer can be used for other conditions and is not restricted to hematology only: any part of a diagnosis procedure which includes classification according to numeric real-valued measurements, i.e. results from a clinical laboratory, can benefit from it.

The only requirement is that effects of the conditions on the measurements are consistant.

AI classifiers takes into account relations and differences that are hard to spot to most Humans systematically.

Efficiency and improvement are good practices independently of the situation.
