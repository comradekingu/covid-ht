Beyond COVID19
==============

``covid-ht`` was motivated to help with the struggle against the COVID19's pandemic in resource-constrainted places where specific testing wasn't available at sufficient quantities. It is designed to be inclusive for those in that situation who want to improve their response: only commodity servers are needed and networking can provide with the knowledge while it is developed locally.

Nevertheless, efficiency and improvement is a good practice independently of the situation.

Given that vaccines are already developed, at some point in the future, the pandemic will end.

After the pandemic, Health resources will be re-oriented towards others health conditions that have been misplaced by COVID19, specially in places where the Health System infrastructure was already insufficient and had to be focused on the pandemic.

Beyond COVID19, ``covid-ht`` provides an AI layer on top of measurements for classification.

That layer can be used for other conditions and is not restricted to hematology: any part of a diagnosis procedure which includes classification according to real-valued measurements, i.e. with results from a clinical laboratory, can benefit from it.

The only requirement is that effects of the conditions on the measurements are consistant.
